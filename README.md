# Overview 
As a new pet owner it can be difficult to know what pet supplies to purchase for a new furry friend. This application helps users to match pet supplies with the type of pet that a user is considering for adoption. 

# Processes
Utilizing an API for petfinder.com and for amazon.com we are able to bring together these two foundational requirements for adopting a pet and having the basic necessities for said pet. 

# Challenges
Currently the API to fetch amazon products is something that has to be paid for. Unfortunately this means that for on going deployment the application won't have this part working.
